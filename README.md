# Uoft Course Planner Android App
The UofT Course Planner project aimed to develop an Android app to assist students in course planning. We set out with key requirements in mind: a user-friendly interface, course information retrieval, schedule generation, and enrollment management. It was important to us to create a tool that would truly make a positive impact on students' academic journeys.

To bring this vision to life, we carefully selected our tools and platforms. Java and Android Studio became our trusted companions, chosen for their robustness, extensive community support, and familiarity among the team members. We wanted to leverage the power of these tools to create an app that would exceed expectations.

The heart of the app lies in its elegant structure, which adheres to the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern. With the model handling data and logic, the view managing the user interface, and the presenter mediating between the two, we achieved a clear separation of concerns and improved testability. MVP became our guiding principle, and it paid off in creating a scalable and maintainable app.

In our quest for excellence, we meticulously organized files and folders, ensuring a well-structured codebase that would be easy to navigate and maintain. We integrated external libraries and dependencies, including the powerful Mockito and JUnit frameworks. These tools became instrumental in conducting thorough unit testing, with our code achieving an impressive 80% coverage. We wanted to deliver an app that was not only visually appealing but also robust and reliable.

The UofT Course Planner boasts a captivating workflow designed to simplify the course planning process for students. With a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation, students can effortlessly search for courses, access detailed information, and generate personalized schedules. Our goal was to create an experience that would make their academic journey a breeze, and we are proud of what we accomplished.

Led by my role as the Scrum Master, our team of 5 developers embraced Agile development principles. We leveraged GitHub for collaboration and version control, ensuring that everyone was on the same page and contributing effectively. The project became a testament to our commitment, enthusiasm, and genuine care for the student community.

Throughout the development process, we remained dedicated to creating an app that would truly make a difference. We meticulously crafted key components, such as the course database, schedule generation algorithm, and enrollment management system. Our passion for excellence led us to leave no stone unturned.

To run the UofT Course Planner, all students need is an Android device or emulator. We provided clear instructions and prerequisites in the documentation, ensuring accessibility for all. We wanted to make sure that every student, regardless of their technical expertise, could benefit from the app's functionalities.

In conclusion, the UofT Course Planner is more than just a projectâ€”it is a testament to our commitment, enthusiasm, and genuine care for the student community. We poured countless hours into its creation, meticulously crafting each component. From the robust Java code to the beautiful layouts we designed with Figma, every aspect of the app was infused with care and attention to detail.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my passion for the UofT Course Planner. I am confident that this app will make a positive impact on students' lives, simplifying their course planning and empowering them in their academic journeys.
